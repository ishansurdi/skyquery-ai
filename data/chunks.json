The radar reflectivity has been corrected for clutter using a combination of a spatial continuity filter and a fuzzy-logic based echo classification algorithm. The velocity folded regions are dealiased using a 2D multipass velocity dealiasing algorithm. The corrected reflectivity and radial velocity are then gridded into 1 km x 1 km x 250 m 3D volumetric grid which can be used by scientists for further meteorological applications.

The first one is the Altimeter derived gridded Map of Absolute Dynamic Topography (MADT) generated from the suite of altimeters such as JASON-2, SARAL/ALTIKA, Cryosat etc., the second data set is the gridded ocean surface vector winds derived ASCAT wind data and the last one is the gridded SST data derived from AVHRR. The methodology presented by Bonjean and Lagerloef, (2002) is used to derive ocean surface current by combining the geostrophic component from altimeter data and the ageostrophic component from scatterometer and radiometer data. The method of deriving the surface current is based on the resolution of quasi-steady quasi-linear momentum equations, neglecting local acceleration. Equatorial velocities are obtained by solving a weak formulation of the momentum equations using a basis set of orthogonal polynomials. Data Access Click Here to access the Science Products .

Processing Steps Using the daily gridded data of MADT, Vector winds and SST data the Geostrophic, wind driven and buoyancy components of the ocean surface current respectively are first calculated for the off-equatorial regions (3°N to 90°N and 3°S to 90°S). Using the polynomial expansion the equatorial currents (±3° latitude band) are derived. The daily ocean surface current at 0.25° resolution is then derived by applying a linear weighted average procedure to the equatorial and off equatorial current solutions with in the latitude band of ± 3° to ± 4° band.

The vertical shear U z reaches zero at a constant scaling depth z = - H . Using complex notations U(x,y,z,t) = u + iv and ∇ = ∂/∂x + i ∂/∂y , the basic equations are if U = - (1/ρ m ) ∇ p + AU z (1a) (1/ρm) p z = -g + ∇θ (1b) ∇θ = g χ T ∇SST , (1c) with - H ≤ z ≤ 0, and subject to the following boundary conditions U z (z=0) = τ / A (2a) U z (z = -H) = 0 (2b) The characteristic density is ρ m = 1025 kg m -3 , The acceleration due to gravity g = 9.8 m s -2 , and the coefficient of thermal expansion χT = 3 x 10 -4 K -1 , The vector field τ = τ x + i τ y represents the surface wind stress divided by ρ m , H has been chosen to be 70 m, The parameter A is chosen by the empirical formulation as A = a (|W|/W1) b | w| 1 m s -1 where W 1 = 1 m s -1 , a = 8 x 10 -5 m 2 s -1 , and b = 2.2 where W 1 = 1 m s -1 , a = 8 x 10 -5 m 2 s -1 , and b = 2.2 .

Using equation (4) and the datasets mentioned above, the daily ocean surface currents were generated. Equatorial velocities (±3° latitude band) are obtained by solving a weak formulation of the momentum equations using a basis set of orthogonal polynomials as described in Bonjean and Lagerloef (2002). Limitations As the equatorial currents are estimated through an approximation procedure using polynomial coefficients the correlation with in-situ currents in the equatorial region is observed to be relatively poorer especially for the meridional currents. Known problems with data As these input satellite data are not very reliable near to the coast, the estimated currents very near to the coast may also have problems.

It carries a Ka band single frequency satellite altimeter (AltiKa). Satellite altimeters are primarily used to study sea level changes. In the open ocean, the altimetric echo follows a standard shape, with steeply rising leading edge followed by a trailing edge with gradually diminishing power. This standard shape is in agreement with the theoretical Brown model and hence can be easily modeled. However, in the coastal areas, due to the presence of land and other coastal featues in the footprint of the altimeter, contamination occurs and the return is different from open ocean. Up to some extent these contaminations can be modeled. Footprint size of SARAL/Altika is small which is ideal for coastal studies. The available ocean retracker (MLE4) itself shows good performance near the coast. However, further improvemnts can be achieved by using algorithms which can simulate contaminations impact in the coastal areas. In this document we have used various models for the return waveforms at 40 Hz to extract maximum information from the altimeter. Our results show that algorithms which are useful in the coastal areas are BETA5, BETA9 and Brown with Asymmetric Gaussian Peak (BAGP). Additionally, a wind power and wave power product has also been generated from this coastal product. 7 Dataset Contact Aditya Chaudhary, OSD/AOSG/EPSA, Space Applications Centre (ISRO), Ahmedabad 380015, aditya.osd@sac.isro.gov.in 8 Update frequency 35 cycles of SARAL/AltiKa have been processed.

The product is based on observations of the recent altimeters Jason-2 (2008-2014) and SARAL/Altika (2013-2014). It is particularly helpful in identification of ocean hotspots for extraction of ocean wave energy, that can be the next generation, environment friendly energy resource.It provides two types of products: Inter-annual monthly product from Jason-2 and SARAL/ALTIKA, Monthly climatology of ocean wave energy. Data Access Click Here to access the Science Products . Request to use MOSDAC Single Sign On user credentials to download the data. Data Version Version 1.0 (beta) Data Sources The significant wave height (SWH) and wind speed for both the altimeters are taken from Jason-2 ( http://www.aviso.oceanobs.com ) SARAL/ALTIKA ( http://www.mosdac.gov.in ) Processing Steps Using Significant Wave Height (SWH) and wind speed, the wave period is derived based on the data adaptive technique of \" Genetic Algorithm \" (Remya et al. 2011) Wave period hence derived is validated using buoy observations from Indian National Center for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS) Wave power is derived based on SWH and estimated wave period References R.

Radar altimetry by satellite is a technique used in oceanography to measure, globally over the oceans, the sea level needed to understand ocean circulation and its variability. The importance of altimetry data to better understand the ocean circulation and its impact on the climate of the Earth led to the TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason series of satellites complemented by ERS1-2, GFO and ENVISAT. With the launch of these missions began a data collection that must continue well into the century in order to monitor the inter-annual evolution and separate transient phenomena from secular variations. SARAL/AltiKa mission belongs to the global altimetry system and then participates to the precise and accurate observations of ocean circulation and sea surface elevation for its life time. Thus it is the aim of AltiKa part of the SARAL mission to provide altimetric measurements designed to study ocean circulation and sea surface elevation with the same accuracy as the one provided by ENVISAT mission and complementary to Jasons mission. The AltiKa project developed by CNES is based on a large Ka-band altimeter (35.75 GHz, 500MHz), 1st oceanographic altimeter using such a high frequency. The use of the Ka-band frequency will supply more accurate measurements (improvement of the spatial and vertical resolution) enabling a better observation of ices, coastal areas, continental water bodies",

The use of the Ka-band frequency will supply more accurate measurements (improvement of the spatial and vertical resolution) enabling a better observation of ices, coastal areas, continental water bodies as well as the waves height. The drawback of this Ka-band frequency is its sensitivity to rain that can lead to signal attenuation. The SARAL/AltiKa mission is part of the operational satellite altimetry system, jointly with Jason-2, and enables to ensure the service continuity which is nowadays provided by ENVISAT altimeter jointly with Jason-2 and Jason-1. By ensuring the observations continuity and widening the observation areas, CNES answers the wish of the oceanography community by bringing a description: For the meso-scale in open ocean,, In coastal areas, For the seasonal forecast, For the hydrology, For the climate studies. AltiKa data will thus contribute, along with data from others altimetry missions, to the development of operational oceanography, to our climate understanding and to the development of forecasting capabilities through data assimilation methods improvement in coupled oceanatmosphere coupling models, bio-chemistry models, etc हिन्दी Missions SARAL-AltiKa Introduction Objectives SpaceCraft Payloads Data Products Documents Search Search Follow Us Website owned and maintained by MOSDAC, Space Applications Centre, Indian Space Research Organisation, Govt. of INDIA.

Also, hydrological modelling studies face the challenge of decreasing availability of in-situ monitoring data. However, application of satellite radar altimetry over the inland water bodies becomes vital tool to estimate water levels through waveform retracking on satellite altimetry?s sensor data. SARAL-Altika was launched on 25 February 2013. It is a joint-mission of CNES France and ISRO to provide continuous monitoring of ocean and continental water surface. It was launched into a Sun synchronous polar orbit at an altitude of 790km with 35 days of orbit repetition and follows same ground track as ENVISAT satellite. It has 98.55 deg of inclination with 75 km of equatorial cross track separation. It has Ka-band (35.75 GHz) radar altimeter. Water level product for inland water bodies (presently for Brahmaputra river and Ukai Reservoir) has been generated using the SARAL-ALTIKA waveform data.

Derivation Techniques and Algorithm The water level over the inland water bodies can be retrieved using altimeter waveforms data. The range information is estimated based on the arrival time of the radar pulse. This range is then corrected for Dry tropospheric correction, wet tropospheric correction, ionospheric correction, and tidal correction, i.e. Load tide, solid earth tide. Detailed information about the range corrections can be found in the ATBD document (S. Chander and Prakash Chauhan, 2013) of the SARAL mission.

This satellite is developed out of a small I-1000 bus made of carbon fibre re-enforced plastic light weight structure, a uni power bus employing an 18AH Ni-Cd battery and a single GaAs/Ge solar panel generating 640 watts of power. Metsat uses a 3-axis stabilized momentum biased attitude control system with suitable linearly controlled magnetic torquers for solar radiation pressure compensation. A unified propulsion system of bi-propellant apogee motor of 440 Newtons and the reaction control engines of 22 Newtons has been selected for efficient and versatile mission management. Metsat carries on-board a Very High ResolutionRadiometer (VHRR) and a Data Relay Transponder (DRT) for weather data transmission. VHRR provides earth imageries in visible band with a resolution of2 km, in thermal infrared and water vapor bands with 8 km. DRT collects weather data from un-attended data collection platforms located throughout India and transmits the same to centrally located Meteorological Data Utilisation Centre. The satellite dry mass is about 495 kg. Metsat was launched on- board upgraded and modified satellite launch vehicle (PSLV) with a lift–off mass of 1060 kgs in September 2002. After successful launch and early orbit operations and in orbit characterization of the Payload, the satellite has been commissioned for routine usage of weather data and imageries. हिन्दी Missions KALPANA-1 Introduction Objectives SpaceCraft Payloads Data Products Search Search Follow Us Website owned and maintained by MOSDAC, Space Applications Centre, Indian Space Research Organisation, Govt.",

The primary input datasets utilized are sea surface salinity data from the SMAP mission and sea surface currents derived from altimetry. These datasets are obtained at a spatial resolution of 25 km. The SMAP mission has been operational since 2015, whereas altimetry-derived sea surface currents have been available since 1993. Validation of this reconstructed product was conducted against in-situ datasets obtained from thermo-salinographs. Results indicate that the reconstructed product more accurately captures front formation compared to the original SMAP salinity fields.

Derivation Techniques and Algorithm The algorithm is called Lagrangian Reconstruction Technique. User should refer [1]. Limitations This algorithm is applicable only in the region with moderate to high eddy kinetic energy and where lateral advection dominates. High resolution sea surface salinity product generated by Lagrangian technique can have error due to tracer bias (depends on accuracy of initial conditions) and advection bias (Passive stirring can introduce bias due to mixing physics (air-sea fluxes, mixing etc.)). Known problems with data Data sets have biases as well as inaccuracy.

This is achieved through the utilization of Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) data derived from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite, in conjunction with sea surface currents obtained from altimetry. By employing forward and backward schemes for the numerical advection of SMAP SSS fields using altimeter-derived geostrophic currents, a Lagrangian reconstruction is produced, capturing smaller-scale features. The reliability of our in-house developed algorithm is assessed by comparing it with an available reconstructed product in the Gulf Stream. Additionally, a preliminary validation is conducted against insitu data obtained from a thermo-salinograph. Further, the developed algorithm was modified to select the advection time dynamically. 7 Dataset Contact Jai Kumar, POD/AOSG/EPSA, Space Applications Centre (ISRO), Ahmedabad, 380015, kumarj@sac.isro.gov.in 8 Update Frequency Six months. 9 Access Rights or Restriction Open Access 10 Spatial Resolution Spatial resolution is 10 km 11 Language English 12 Topic Category High resolution sea surface salinity product (SAC-TDP) using satellite data. 13 Keywords Sea surface salinity, sea surface currents, Lagrangian advection technique, high resolution 14 Date or period April 2015 - June 2023 15 Responsible Party Jai Kumar, POD/AOGG/ EPSA, Space Applications Centre (ISRO), Ahmedabad-380015, India 16 Organization Space Applications Centre (ISRO), Ahmedabad, India 16a Org. role Geophysical parameters from satellite data in the Bay of Bengal region. 16b Individual name Jai Kumar, POD/AOSG/EPSA, SAC (ISRO), Ahmedabad-380015, India.

The inputs are sea surface height anomaly (AVISO), sea surface density anomaly; which is calculated using GHRSST sea surface temperature and SMAP sea surface salinity. One more input is the Brunt-Vaisala frequency, calculated from in-situ analysis system (ISAS) climatological data. The results show that isQG retrieved subsurface density anomalies are very promising compared to RAMA buoy data in the cold season when EKE is minimum. Validation of retrieved density has also been performed using ARGO data which reveals that isQG is more promising when the stratification is weak .

Derivation Techniques and Algorithm The algorithm is called interior + surface Quasi-Geostrophic(isQG) method. User should refer doi:10.1175/JPO-D-12-0204.1. Limitations This method is only applicable in a region where the Coriolis parameter does not change abruptly. Also it is not applicable on the equator. Vertical movement is ignored in isQG framework. isQG method works well when the eddy kinetic energy (EKE) is low. If EKE is large, it will fail to generate accurate subsurface fields. We considered the Barotropic and the first Baroclinic modes only in our analysis. This certainly limits our approach. This method generates less satisfactory subsurface fields if the stratification is strong. The vertical resolution in our case is 10 m. This is a major drawback since in Bay of Bengal, the mixed layer can be as shallow as 15-20 m. Known problems with data Data problems due to bad weather (heavy rain) and extreme events like cyclones etc. File Naming Conventio n Netcdf file: isQG_yyyy.nc MetaData Sr. No Core Metadata Elements Definition 1 Metadata language English 2 Metadata",

The inputs are sea surface height anomaly (AVISO), sea surface density anomaly; which is calculated using GHRSST sea surface temperature and SMAP sea surface salinity. One more input is the Brunt-Vaisala frequency, calculated from in-situ analysis system (ISAS) climatological data. The results show that isQG retrieved subsurface density anomalies are very promising compared to RAMA buoy data in the cold season when EKE is minimum. Validation of retrieved density has also been performed using ARGO data which reveals that isQG is more promising when the stratification is weak . 7 Dataset Contact Anup Kumar Mandal, OSD/AOSG/EPSA, Space Applications Centre (ISRO), Ahmedabad, 380015, anupmandal@sac.isro.gov.in 8 Update Frequency Six months. 9 Access Rights or Restriction Open Access 10 Spatial Resolution Spatial resolution is 25 km, while vertical resolution is 10m 11 Language English 12 Topic Category Ocean subsurface product (SAMUDRA Project) using satellite data. 13 Keywords Density anomaly, Velocity anomaly, subsurface fields, 3D-Ocean fields 14 Date or period January 2017 - till date 15 Responsible Party Anup Kumar Mandal,OSD/AOGG/ EPSA, Space Applications Centre (ISRO), Ahmedabad-380015, India 16 Organization Space Applications Centre (ISRO), Ahmedabad, India 16a Org. role Geophysical parameters from satellite data in the Bay of Bengal region. 16b Individual name Anup Kumar Mandal, OSD/AOSG/EPSA, SAC (ISRO), Ahmedabad-380015, India.

It is currently available from March 2000 Onwards and offers a horizontal resolution of 0.1°X 0.1° on a latitude/longitude grid with a temporal resolution of 1 hour. The dataset is based on the Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP) algorithm (Kubota et al. 2020; Kumar et al. 2021, 2022) with Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) gauge correction, and is a specialized product that focuses on the Indian landmass. The GSMaP algorithm, designed by the JAXA, is instrumental in creating a comprehensive view of precipitation using microwave radiometers and cloud moving data from Geostationary Infrared (IR) technology. The algorithm is separated into three primary categories for effective measurement: the microwave imager, microwave sounder, and microwave-infrared (MVK) combined (Mega et al. 2019). A detailed verification of GSMaP_ISRO for the Indian summer monsoon periods of 2000-2020 against ground, satellite and various merge rainfall products is presented in Kumar et al. (2022).

Merged and gridded satellite altimeter product of sea surface height (SSH) anomaly at 7-day interval having special resolution of 0.25o has been used for present study. Mesoscale oceanic eddies have been identified and tracked in weekly merged altimeter product of Sea Surface Height (SSH) from AVISO. Eddies have been identified based on closed contour approach followed by shape criteria. An automated tracking algorithm has been employed to track these eddies with different lifetime. The trajectories of eddies have been computed from their time history. Present method has been used separately for cold core and warm core eddies. There are 24 files each containing weekly eddy data information for individual year. Data Access Click Here to access the Science Products .

The closed contours are sequentially identified, analysed and checked essential criteria. Size and amplitude based thresholds for eddy detection were fixed after carrying out several trials. Eddies are detected and calculated the eddy parameters. Detected eddies are tracked individually. References Chelton, D. B., M. G. Schlax, R. M. Samelson, and R. A. de Szoeke (2007), Global observations of large oceanic eddies, Geophys. Res. Lett., 34, L15606, doi:10.1029/2007GL030812. Derivation Techniques and Algorithm We have followed Chelton et. Al. 2007 in deriving the eddy census in Bay of Bengal with minor modifications in fixing the thresholds for eddy detection specific to this region. This was achieved after performing several trial experiments with different combinations of size and amplitude values. Limitations Accuracy assessment of the dataset has not been carried out. The number of eddies are depending upon the diameter and amplitude threshold. Only mesoscale eddies with maximum diameter of 400km are being considered. Known problems with data Less reliability of SSH data near the coast with altimetry is a known problem. Related data collections http://www.aviso.altimetry.fr/en/data/data-access/registration-form.html File Naming Convention The typical file name is 'eddy_parameter_YYYY.nc' or ‘YYYY.gif’ where 'eddy_parameter’ signifies that this product consists of eddy parameters. 'YYYY' corresponds to the year, ex: 2015. All the data files are in NetCDF 4 format and the images are in gif format.

SARAL is an acronym for \"SAtellite for ARgos and ALtiKa\" with two payloads namely AltiKa, a Ka-band (35-GHz) radar altimeter and ARGOS, a data collection platform for a variety of physical and biological data from ocean in-situ instruments like Ocean buoys etc. SARAL realizes ocean radar altimetry through a suite of altimetry payloads which includes the DORIS and LRA instruments for precise orbit determination (POD); a dual-frequency microwave radiometer (MWR) at 24/37GHz for water vapor correction. At 35 GHz, not only is the ionospheric contamination of the pulse echo negligible, it also gives a better vertical resolution of about 0.3m for wave estimation and a compact, light-weight instrument for greater portability. The objectives of AltiKa mission are: To realize precise, repetitive global measurements of sea surface for studying mesoscale variability, developing coastal oceanography, inland waters and ice sheets monitoring and understanding of climate change.

This product was conceived in the framework of deriving high resolution “Coastal Product” project under SARAL/AltiKa mission. This coastal product is an experimental product derived from SARAL/AltiKa S-IGDR tracks. The document provides an insight to coastal product and various algorithms used in its derivation. It is advised that user refer the SARAL/AltiKa product handbook (SARAL/AltiKa User Handbook, Dec, 2013), as present document is an add-on with specific retrackers and quality flags for 40-Hz data processing. Figure 1. Different tracks of SARAL AltiKa (in white) near Indian coast used in the study. Tracks are overlaid on ocean bathymetry. Along-track coastal 40-Hz products are derived up to 50 km from the coast. 11.1 Overview of the product In Open Ocean, the altimetric echo follows a standard shape, with steeply rising leading edge followed by a trailing edge with gradually diminishing power. This standard shape is in agreement with the theoretical Brown model (Brown 1977) and hence can be easily modeled. Output of the Brown model is sea surface height (SSH), significant wave height (SWH) and backscatter coefficient (Sigma (0)). Sea surface height anomaly (SSHA) is further computed from SSH. The waveforms measured in the coastal area do not conform to the theoretical Brown model due to land contamination and inaccurate geophysical corrections. Special data processing efforts are needed for coastal region. SARAL/AltiKa coastal product is concerned with providing the geo-physical parameters SSHA, SSH, SWH and Wind Speed from the retracking algorithms BETA5, BETA9 and BAGP at 40-Hz data rate. The distance between the consecutive points in the 40-Hz data is approximately 180 meters. Geophysical products have been computed along the tracks of SARAL/AltiKa in the coastal regions of Indian Mainland. The tracks are shown in Fig. 1 in white. List of tracks are provided (in ascending order) here: 0010, 0023, 0038, 0051, 0066, 0081, 0096, 0109, 0124, 0137, 0152, 0182, 0195, 0210, 0223, 0238, 0281, 0296, 0309, 0324, 0367, 0382, 0395, 0410, 0423, 0453, 0468, 0481, 0496, 0509, 0524, 0539, 0554, 0567, 0582, 0595, 0610, 0640, 0653, 0668, 0681, 0696, 0726, 0739, 0754, 0767, 0782, 0825, 0840, 0853, 0868, 0911, 0926, 0939, 0954, 0967, 0997 Users can use links in http://www.aviso.altimetry.fr/en/data/tools/pass-locator.html to locate the SARAL/AltiKa tracks.

Processing involved in the coastal product and parameters provided Prior to describing, the processing involved in deriving coastal products, it will be useful to understand the procedure involved in the computation of geo physical parameters from altimeter in the open ocean. In the following sections we first discuss the open ocean altimeter data processing. 3.1 Altimeter Data Processing for Open Ocean Basic measurement of an altimeter is in form of a time series known as waveform in which power is distributed along various measuring gates of an altimeter as depicted in Figure 2. These gates arise due to signal processing and decide the vertical resolution of the altimeter. A model is fitted to the altimeter waveform, and the model parameters provide the geophysical parameters or their corrections. Fitted model is shown as blue curve in the same Figure. This process of modeling the altimetric waveform is known as retracking and the specific model used for retracking is known",

A theoretical model (known as MLE4 retracker), based on the scattering of a radar pulse from the sea-surface, was formulated by Brown (1977) and is extensively used for open ocean waveform retracking. 3Figure 2.

Fitting the waveform model with the altimetric waveform is done using the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) technique explained in Amarouche et al. (2004). After fitting the theoretical model to the altimetric waveform three basic parameters are computed as described in the following sub-sections. 53.1.1 Computation of Sea Surface Height Anomaly Parameter 𝑡 computed from equation 3.1 gives retracking correction to the range calculated by 0 the onboard tracker on the satellite.

Altimeter range is then subtracted from the Altitude of satellite to give the SSH. Geophysical corrections in the altimeter will be discussed in the Section 5. SSH = Altitude - Corrected Altimeter Range Sea Surface Height Anomaly (SSHA) is then calculated by subtracting Mean Sea Surface (MSS). MSS is the long term mean of the Sea Surface Height calculated by averaging the SSH by the previous satellite altimeters. SSHA = SSH - MSS 3.1.2 Computation of Significant Wave Height 𝜎 from equation 3.1 is the composite rise time of the waveform. This parameter is obtained by 𝑐 fitting the waveform with the theoretical model. Antenna characteristic 𝜎 is already known. So 𝑝 we can compute 𝜎 which is root mean square (RMS) surface elevation. 𝑠 ( 2 σ )2 = σ2 - σ2 s c p c where c is speed of light SWH is approximated as four times the RMS elevation 𝜎 . 𝑠 𝑆𝑊𝐻 = 4𝜎 𝑠 63.1.3 Computation of Wind Speed Wind speed is obtained generally using empirical relationships based on backscatter coefficient 𝜎 which is obtained by the ′𝐴′ term in the equation 3.1 as follows 0 𝝈 (𝒅𝑩) = 𝟏𝟎𝐥𝐨𝐠(𝑨)+𝒔𝒄𝒂𝒍𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒇𝒂𝒄𝒕𝒐𝒓+𝒂𝒕𝒎𝒐𝒔𝒑𝒆𝒉𝒆𝒓𝒊𝒄 𝒄𝒐𝒓𝒓𝒆𝒄𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏 𝟎 +𝒊𝒏𝒔𝒕𝒓𝒖𝒎𝒆𝒏𝒕 𝒄𝒐𝒓𝒓𝒆𝒄𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏𝒔 Scaling factor accounts for all the parameters of the radar equation except the amplitude of the waveform. 𝜎 is also accounted for the atmospheric correction due to propagation in medium 0 and the instrument corrections. The wind speed is calculated in S-IGDR by using one dimensional model given by Lillibridge et al. (2014) which is a function of backscatter coefficient.

(3.2) is used for calculating wind speed from backscatter coefficient obtained from all the retracking algorithms. Note: In general, the geophysical parameters are calculated at 40-Hz and then averaged over 1-Hz by using some filtering procedure. But in coastal regions 1-Hz resolution which is approx. 7 km, is not very useful to provide the resolution needed for most of the coastal applications. 40-Hz data can be noisy due to limited averaging. Therefore, 40-Hz data can be used for research purposes in coastal regions. It is suggested that the 40-Hz data should be filtered and averaged according to the specific applications. Geophysical parameters computed from the Ocean retracker as provided in the S-IGDR product are also provided. The list of these parameters is given below: SSHA :: ssha_mle4_40hz 7SSH :: ssh_mle4_40hz SWH :: swh_mle4_40hz WIND SPEED :: wind_speed_mle4_40hz 3.2 Retracking algorithms used in the coastal product Although eqn. 3.1 (ocean model) works well in the Open Ocean, in the coastal areas this model fails due to incursion of the land in the footprint of the altimeter as shown in Figure 4. In order to encounter this contamination, specific retracking algorithms are used in the coastal regions. Figure 4. Sample waveform in the Coastal Ocean from SARAL/AltiKa (red) and fitted with the Open Ocean model (blue). In coastal product we have provided three types of retrackers which are useful for the retrieval of parameters in the coastal region. These retrackers are discussed in the following sections. 3.2.1 Beta retracker with exponential edge Martin et al. (1983) developed a retracking algorithm for processing altimeter waveforms over continental ice sheets. This algorithm was used to retrack all SEASAT radar altimeter waveforms. This retracker was found useful in many coastal studies eg. Deng (2003) 8The algorithm fits a 5 or 9-parameter function to the altimeter waveform. The first function is for fitting returns with single ramp in the trailing edge while the second one is used to fit returns with double ramps in the trailing edge. Single-ramp returns are modeled by 5-parameter model (Figure 5). The functional form for which is given in the equation below: W(t) = β +β (1+β Q)P( t-β3) (3.3) 1 2 5 β4 where 0 for t",

Reasons for specifically using BETA5 and BETA9 retarckers is because SARAL/AltiKa has very low mispointing angle which gives an exponential form to trailing edge of the waveform. So the linear trailing edge is not an appropriate choice for retracking. The method used for fitting model to the waveform is an iterative non-linear fitting approach, which is the least squares method with appropriate weighing scheme (Deng, 2003).

Shape Classification of altimetric waveforms Different type of shapes of waveforms other than the standard deep ocean type (Brown type) waveforms are usually encountered in the coastal areas. The algorithms discussed in the Section 3.2 were based on modeling the shapes of the coastal waveforms, so it becomes necessary to classify the waveform based on predefined shape.

As shown in the Figure 7 there are different types of shape in which waveforms are classified. Explanation of these classes is given as follows: Class 1: Brown type waveforms; which are characteristic for deep ocean and follows Brown model. 15Class 2: Peak echoes; which are received due to high reflectance either due to still water presence or due to high reflection from land. Class 3: Very noisy type echoes; having a lot of noise and no shape feature is identified. Class 4: Peak at the end of echoes; found near land. Class 5: Brown + peaky echoes; these type along with class7 are received when both ocean and land exist in the footprint of altimeter. It is a mixed type of signal. Class 6: Linear; found near land or due to on-board tracker errors Class 7: Brown + peak on the trailing edge; described in class 5. Class 8: Peaky + Noise echoes; formed due to high reflectance from land in the footprint of altimeter. Figure 7.

Note: It is suggested to users should not use the very noisy (Class 3), peak with noise (Class 8), Peak at the end (Class 4) and Linear (Class 6) because they have very high noise or tracker failures 5. Geophysical Corrections There are various geophysical corrections which need to be applied to the range measurements to account for the signal delay. All these corrections are provided in the S-IGDR product as 1 Hz. The same values have been interpolated at 40-Hz using cubic spline interpolation. No specific processing of the corrections in this version of coastal product has been done. However, for the sake of brevity, standard corrections provided in S-IGDR version for 1-Hz are listed below: 1) Dry Tropospheric correction This correction is due to the presence of the dry air medium between the satellite and the oceans which affects the velocity of propagation of the radio pulse.

European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) numerical weather prediction models are used to compute the surface pressure (Chelton et.al ,2001) and then inverse barometer corrections. These values are provided in S-IGDR product. In the present coastal product, the variable dry_tropo_model_interp_40hz represents the 40-Hz interpolated dry tropospheric corrections. 2) Wet Tropospheric correction This correction is due to the presence of water vapor and the liquid water. It is highly variable in the atmosphere and many times the correction reaches up to 40 cm. It is corrected in the open ocean by the use of onboard MWR at different frequencies. In the coastal areas, however, the radiometer itself is contaminated thus providing inaccurate corrections. Therefore, since the present product is within 50 km, wet tropospheric corrections calculated from the ECMWF 17model is used. These corrections are once again interpolated to 40-Hz. It is provided as wet- tropo_model_interp_40hz in the product. 3) Tidal corrections There are three types of contributions to the tidal effect: a) Geocentric Ocean tide This correction is taken from the original S-IDGR data, interpolated at 40-Hz and is provided as geoc_ocean_tide_sol1_interp_40hz. It is calculated from GOT 4.8 Ocean Tide Model Ray (1999) b) Solid Earth tide This correction is taken from the original S-IDGR data, interpolated at 40-Hz and is provided as solid_earth_tide_interp_40hz. More details about this correction is provided in SARAL/AltiKa Product Handbook (December, 2013). c) Pole tide This correction is taken from the original S-IDGR data, interpolated at 40-Hz and is provided as pole_tide_interp_40hz. It is calculated in IGDR as described in Wahr (1985). Users can refer SARAL/AltiKa Products Handbook (December, 2013) for details about these corrections. 4) Sea state Bias corrections This correction arises due to asymmetry of the reflecting properties of various scattering elements contributing for the average return. Troughs on the reflecting surface reflect better than the crests which creates the bias of the measured heights towards the troughs. Also the instrument measures the median rather than the mean scattering surface which creates an additional error. The distribution of the reflecting elements",

    "chunk": "elements contributing for the average return. Troughs on the reflecting surface reflect better than the crests which creates the bias of the measured heights towards the troughs. Also the instrument measures the median rather than the mean scattering surface which creates an additional error. The distribution of the reflecting elements on the surface is skewed rather than symmetrical. This error is due to sea state and hence known as sea state bias. This is computed by empirical algorithms as described in Labroure (2004). This correction is provided as sea_state_bias_interp_40hz. 185) Ionospheric Corrections This correction arises due to slowing down of group velocity of radar pulse by the presence of free electrons in the ionosphere. Ionospheric correction in Ka band altimeter is one order less than Ku band altimeters. Dual frequency ionospheric correction is not possible in SARAL/AltiKa due to the absence of additional altimeter frequency. Therefore, external data are used to compute ionospheric correction. Total Electron Content computed from GPS based observations and ionosphere model (JPL GIM model) are used to account for this correction. 6) Inverse Barometer Corrections This correction corresponds to the change in sea level due to variations in atmospheric pressure variations. Higher the pressure lower is the sea level. It is computed from the surface pressure values as provided by numerical prediction model (NWP) and dry tropospheric correction. In the present version of the coastal product, it is provided as inv_barr_interp_40hz. This correction given for 1-Hz data in S-IGDR has been once again interpolated to 40-Hz data. 7) High frequency fluctuation Corrections This correction is ocean’s response to the wind and pressure and has energy at periods shorter than 20 days. It is considered as the departure from the inverse barometers effect to pressure and additionally wind effects. This correction is calculated by using specific models (SARAL/AltiKa Products Handbook, 2013). These corrections are interpolated at 40-Hz and provided as hf_fluctuations_interp_40hz. More details about this correction are in Stammer et al. (1999) and Tierney et al. (2000). 6. Mean Sea Surface, Geoid and Bathymetry In order to compute the SSHA, MSS is required. SARAL/AltiKa S-IGDR product provides MSS from MSS_CNES_CLS11 model which is computed from 16 years of satellite altimetry data. 1- Hz MSS data has been interpolated to 40-Hz. 19There are two different geoid provided in the product. One is geoid_interp_40hz which is interpolated at 40-Hz from the EGM96 geopotential model (Lemoine et al., (1998)) provided",
