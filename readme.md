# 🌌 AI Help Bot for Satellite Data Portals

An intelligent, conversational assistant built to simplify access to space and satellite data. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP), a Knowledge Graph (KG), and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide fast, relevant, and geospatially-aware responses to user queries.
